SoftwareEngineeringProject
==========================

This is the project my team did for CS455 (Software Engineering).  We did not use github at the time.  That means weird things like folders and .zip files with names like "v.1.03".  Also, since we used google drive, there are some files in that format.

I am uploading it here now so that (a) I will have my own copy and (b) It will be on my portfolio.


Feel free to look around, modify, etc.  I did not write all the code, obviously.  I tried to keep my code documented, but due to the last min frenzy of trying to meet our deadline, some of my code is probably unmarked.  The point is, if you see some really bad code with no documentation, it may not be mine.  Also, if you see some really good code with no documentation, it was probably not mine (I tried extra hard to sign my good code :P )
